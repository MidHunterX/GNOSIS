> For sharing knowledge

The "GNOSIS-for sharing knowledge" is an ambitious project designed to transform the way individuals engage with and acquire knowledge in the realm of computer functionality. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the demand for comprehensive and accessible information has never been greater. This platform seeks to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and userfriendly learning by providing a dynamic and interactive space where users can post questions and receive tailored responses in their preferred format. At its core, the platform is built on the foundation of inclusivity and accessibility, recognizing that users have diverse learning styles and preferences.

git clone https://github.com/MidHunterX/GNOSIS
```

### Step 2: Initialize Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Install Python and execute following commands:

```sh
python -m pip install virtualenv
python -m venv ENV
```

### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment

Using the command based on your current shell

```sh
# CMD
ENV\Scripts\activate.bat
# Powershell
.\ENV\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Bash and Zsh
source ENV/bin/activate
# Fish
source ENV/bin/activate.fish
```

### Step 4: Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Create Admin Account (optional)

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

# üèÉ Running Project

Execute `runserver.bat` if you are on Windows. <br>
Or run server manually by doing the following steps:

### Step 1: Activate Virtual Environment

Using the command based on your current shell

```sh
# CMD
ENV\Scripts\activate.bat
# Powershell
.\ENV\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Bash and Zsh
source ENV/bin/activate
# Fish
source ENV/bin/activate.fish
```

### Step 2: Run Server

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Faced

### Question Search Logic

Task: Search for an input question in a database. If question found, return question; else, return generated answer.

- Searching for questions based on string comparison won't work on spelling mistakes and rephrased questions
- Spelling mistakes issue can be solved using Levenshtein distance which finds the similarity of two strings
- With that set, the rest of the input can be compared using Fuzzy Logic which returns questions similar enough
- So, the best approach is to use Fuzzy Logic based on string similarity percentage.
- If similarity percentage is set high, it might skip slightly rephrased questions.
- If similarity percentage is set low, wrong questions with similar words might be returned.
