# ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems Faced

### Question Search Logic

Task: Search for an input question in a database. If question found, return question; else, return generated answer.

- Searching for questions based on string comparison won't work on spelling mistakes and rephrased questions
- Spelling mistakes issue can be solved using Levenshtein distance which finds the similarity of two strings
- With that set, the rest of the input can be compared using Fuzzy Logic which returns questions similar enough
- So, the best approach is to use Fuzzy Logic based on string similarity percentage.
- If similarity percentage is set high, it might skip slightly rephrased questions.
- If similarity percentage is set low, wrong questions with similar words might be returned.
